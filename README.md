# Dynamic Pricing & Revenue Optimization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to understand price-demand behavior and identify the optimal price that maximizes revenue.

## Problem Statement
Companies often struggle to set the right price. Too high reduces demand, too low reduces profit. This project uses data analytics to guide pricing decisions.

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Demand modeling
4. Elasticity-based pricing simulation
5. Revenue optimization
6. Tableau dashboard visualization

## Key Insights
- Historical data showed limited price variation, requiring elasticity-based modeling.
- Demand varies by season.
- Discounts increase demand but must be used strategically.
- A revenue-maximizing price region was identified.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Tableau

## Outcome
Developed a data-driven pricing strategy and interactive dashboard to support business decision-making.
